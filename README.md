# SlackFishCloud üê†
Never forget to delete your AWS daily tests. SlackFishCloud sends messages to Slack channels alerting you to running AWS resources.

## Dependencies üîó
<b>OS</b>:
- GNU/Linux or WSL

<b>Will be installed via `install.sh` if necessary:</b>
- jq
- figlet
- AWS CLI v.2+ (<b>requires configuration</b>)

## Install ‚öôÔ∏è
<b>Steps:</b>
1. `chmod +x install.sh slack_fish_cloud.sh`
2. Run `./install.sh` to set the default AWS CLI profile and a Slack Webhook URL for your workspace

For more information about Slack Webhooks, see <a href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks" target="_blank">Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks</a>

## Quick usage guide üìö
Get EC2 running resources (ASGs, volumes and instances) in `us-east-1`:
```bash
./sfc.sh --regions us-east-1
```

You can also pass other regions separated by spaces:
```bash
./sfc.sh --regions us-east-1 us-east-2 af-south-1 eu-west-3
```

Example in Slack:

<b>NOTE:</b> only instances and volumes created on the same day of the script execution will be considered

## Open plans üìå
- New filters
- Set up schedulers with crontab
- Project more EC2 attributes in messages
- Implement a multi-cloud version (Azure + GCP)
- Add support in other AWS services/resources, e.g. Snapshots and S3 buckets
