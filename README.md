## Quick usage guide üìö
Get EC2 running instances (not launched via ASGs) using custom regions:

In Slack:

<b>OBS*</b>: if you don't specify any region, the default region set during `install.sh` will be used.

## Open plans üìå
- New filters
- Set up schedulers with crontab
- Project more EC2 attributes in messages
- Implement a multi-cloud version (Azure + GCP)
- Add support in other AWS services/resources, e.g. ASGs, Snapshots, EBS disks, S3 buckets
